* `doc` is for documentation, report, etc. Create a dir for your team there, e.g., `teamX`, and initialize the report document there.
* **LaTeX use is strongly preferred**
* `templates/report-latex-easychair` is the most documented example template in LaTeX, single column, more readable. To be able to compile LaTeX report, install and configure [MiKTeX](miktex.org) first (LaTeX backend compiler and styles and packages), then [TeXnicCenter](texniccenter.org) (GUI front-end to MikTeX, it will find MikTeX installation when installed after MikTeX). Open `project-report.tcp` project file for TeXnicCenter and compile it using F7 3 times; F5 to preview the PDF.
* `templates/report-latex-ieee` two-column IEEE LaTeX template (the instructions here are pretty much the same as for easychair) 
* `templates/report-word-ieee` two-column IEEE Word template
* `templates/peer-evaluation-form.rtf` to use if there are disputes within teams
